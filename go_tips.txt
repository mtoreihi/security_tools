# Golang Notes
Anything (variable, type, or function) that starts with a capital letter is exported, and visible outside the package.
Anything that does not start with a capital letter is not exported, and is visible only inside the same package.
In order to have a nested struct as json (by using json.MarshalIndent) the name of the variables must be capital.
